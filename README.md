**Analysis (Insights):**

The above generated Chart of Weakly Active Users(WAU) data represents "User Growth Accounting for a Company" similar to Monthly Active Users(MAU) as mentioned in article. It also gives the insights like the MAU Growth Accounting.

The insights we can observe from the above User Growth Accounting of WAU are:

1. **Retention and Churn Rate:** The average rentention rate is "72%" and so average churn rate(100% - 72%) is "28%". So, here more users are retened than the churned users. This gives the positive sign for growth of company.

2. **Quick Ratio:** Here, quick ratio is between 0.5 to 2(Approximatly). These means for every 2 new users the company is to loose 1 to 4 users as churns. We can say that the company is having drop and increase in users in a very fluctuated manner(with spikes).

**Conclusion**: Here according to comparision between (New users + Ressurcted users) and Churned users the company is not growing faster. and due to fluctuation of spikes in Quick Ratio can upgrades and degrades the growth of company based on some situations like campaigns. But, It's Retention Rate is much stable and better than chruned rate. So, majorly retention rate plays a main role to make the company to sustain and also to grow gradually. By this we can say that this company can sustain in future with a gradual growth in users.
